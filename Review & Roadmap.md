# State of Project

## Demo Presented

I presented the demo as planned to Jeff and Chris at Redgate, I plan on taking this demo a little further because I have enjoyed working with the concepts presented in it.

## Code

The code is accurately described as what happens when your only tool is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail. As the first steps to improving this based on the comments I got when presenting the demo I will be taking the time to learn how to improve the code in a C# flavor rather than a C++ flavor.

Some of these changes are obviouse such as moving each class to a seperate file, while others are more subtle such as learning how to make the best use of the C# libraries.

## Reflection on the Project

I feel like the first phase of the project was a success and that I learned new things implementing it. C# turned out to be a more welcoming language than I anticipated, I confess that prior to using it I had it pegged as "That language that is also Java" in my head, however Java feels alot more lifeless in comparission to even basic C#. I also got to glympse the power of the tools that C# employees in a typical development cycle, these seemed most promising to me, and over all I would describe the language as more enabeling than it is restrictive.

## This Cycle

There are many issues that I will be addressing this cycle:
- [ ] Code layout and consistency.
- [ ] Documentation.
- [ ] Unit tests.
- [ ] Building an API.
- [ ] Making more effective use of C# features and coding idioms.
- [ ] Expanding the genetic algorithm and neural network implementations.
- [ ] Creating a statistics and insights window.
- [ ] Fixing issues #1, #2, and #3.

This will be split over several milestones and a few weeks and will involve learning new things, so it is likley that a deadline for a milestone will be moved as needed to complete each task.

## Then What?

Next cycle will involve it's own round of learning, bug fixing, and reflection on the code. However I suspect that by dealing with many of these problems now there will be less of this in the next cycle, and as such more time to implement new features.
